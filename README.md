# BattleMath
**Purpose**
  Create a basic expandable program that will calculate damage between two armies.
These armies can consist of multiple players or npc's.
  This should be an initial template that can be taken by the clients lead and modified as more
game features are added.

**Stipulations**
  Two things to note are that the game this was made for had already been live
for about half a year and the original developer for the template didn't turn anything in.
  So this template was a critical ask / expectation from players and needed to be made fast as
players will already view this as late.

**Result**
  Was able to create, meet with client Lead for review, add any additional functionality requests,
    and submit the template in a way that the client Lead was happy with and in a timeline that the
    Project Manager was excited about.
